# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The only supported version is the most current
[release](https://github.com/directord/iodict/releases). while it may
be possible to backport changes to previous releases, doing so is a labor
of love.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability with iodict please raise an issue and
let us know in chat, on the [`libra chat`](https://libera.chat/guides/connect)
network.
